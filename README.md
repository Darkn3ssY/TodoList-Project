# LOGIN PAGE 

A login page with Firebase database and Google Sign-in would allow users to securely sign into the TODO list app using their Google account. Firebase would handle the authentication and database management, while Google Sign-in would provide a seamless way for users to log in. Once the user is successfully logged in, they will be redirected to the TODO list app where they can view and manage their tasks.

# REGISTER PAGE 

A register page for a to-do list application would allow users to create a new account in order to access and use the app. The page would have fields for the user to input their personal information such as username, email and password which would be required for creating an account. Once the user completes the registration process and their account is successfully created, they will be able to log in and start using the to-do list application.

# Todo List interface 

Our to-do list project is a task management application that allows users to add, delete, and update tasks. The tasks can be organized into two main categories: completed and incomplete. Users can easily switch between the two lists to view and manage their tasks. The application also allows users to mark tasks as completed or incomplete, making it easy to track progress and stay on top of their tasks. Overall, the application provides a simple and efficient way to organize and manage tasks.
